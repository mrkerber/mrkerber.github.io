                    but they woke up to three and a half feet of fresh powder. It was the month
                    before summer, less than a month before school let out; the kind of unexpected
                    snowfall a kid could only dream of. They chattered about meeting their friends
                    on the school football field, the pack-ability of the snow, whether it would
                    stop anytime soon, while rushing to get out the door and into the cold.</span></p>

                    the glass, pellets of ice gathering on top of each other in the middle of May,
                    billions of unique flakes forming one solid blanket over their town and over
                    North Carolina, maybe the world. Not enough to trap them inside, but just

                <p>
                    The morning of the third day of 1993 blew away the cloud of winter in a long dry huff. One hour, grass was frozen together in links of dewdrops; houses
                    were bunched up like bundles of kindling. And then, with no more hesitation than a sunrise, the sound of falling water spread through the neighborhood.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It was like someone had opened an oven door. The warmth was welcome after two months of ice and kerosene heaters. In that first day, some children went all
                    but naked, shedding winter clothing for their summer skins. They dragged their lightest clothing from closets and basements. They let fly the windows, ran
                    through the fields, plunged their feet into grass; they breathed like free men.
                </p>
                <p>
                    They had to go to church. The past six weeks of 80 degree weather for a winter in Ohio meant there was more than a warm front descending on the town. They
                    dressed in their Sunday clothes Sunday through Friday, through school and evening mass. The pews filled up with well-pleated parents and unconcerned
                    children.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "&#8230; to the Father, and to the son&#8230;"
                </p>
                <p>
                    The brothers sat three abreast: one tall, one average, one short. Their mother and father sat together on their left, listening with eyes and ears. The
                    three had their eyes forward, heads up, hands in their laps, feet on the ground, and minds somewhere in the clouds above the town.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "&#8230; As it was in the beginning, is now&#8230;"
                </p>
                <p>
                    They fidgeted fresh wrinkles into their pants every time they shifted. The sermon was almost at its 120<sup>th</sup> minute. They tapped out the last few
                    seconds on their thighs in tempo with the pastor.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "&#8230; and ever shall be, world without end."
                </p>
                <p>
                    The congregation joined in on the final 'amen'. The organ bellowed a last song out into the chamber as the crowd flowed out of the aisles and into the late
                    afternoon. The three were already down the steps of the church and under the winter sun, leaving their parents for their own walk home.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Here's the plan," Danny walked backwards to gather up the eyes of the brothers. "We head to Johnny's house and pick him up, hopefully, if we can avoid his
                    parents. Then we'll hit up Miro at the Croatian Station for a couple cases&#8230;" Then they hurried back to their house and tossed their Sunday clothes
                    onto the top of the heap, dirty or not. Then Billy grabbed the food, Bobby and Johnny got the sleeping bags, and Danny being the oldest waited on the curb.
                    They were out of the house and back on the road before their parents had even rounded onto their street. They grabbed the beer hidden in a bush, circled
                    back down Brewer Lane parallel to their own, stopped by Mary's on the way ("Definitely. We'll be there," she told them) and hustled the few more blocks to
                    the edge of Beaver Ridge forest. At the point they crossed the threshold of trees on the edge of Shelby, Pastor Dave was probably finally done ushering old
                    Brenda and Perry Wilson out of earshot and out of the church until Sunday.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The path was well worn and poorly kept. Oak trees stretched out over the trail in an endless pattern of woven branches. They walked for a little more than
                    a mile until they reached a long sycamore limb wedged high above between two trees on their left. The five of them walked under the arch and onto what did
                    not appear to be a trail. But here and there the leaves were stamped down and twigs were broken. Weeds didn't grow as thick along the line they followed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The year before, when the hottest part of the year fell on green canopies, the brothers built a treehouse: Danny, Billy, and Bobby. The earlier part of the
                    summer was spent planning it and the last twenty days actually building it. As if the hand of God had reached down and curled their fingers around a
                    hammer, they finished with a single night left before the school year started.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The four stood under the tree, sweating from the journey, looking up at the weathered planks of the hideout.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Alrighty. Let's do it. Here's to heat!" Johnny ripped open a case and let fly a beer in Danny's direction. Johnny and Danny had been white-on-rice since
                    they met on the bus the first day of middle school. Danny grabbed it from the air and cracked the top, raising his fist to the sun, proudly letting the
                    foam spill to the ground. Johnny tossed out two more and grabbed one for himself.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The three cracked the seals and raised them to the sky.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <em>Well, here's to heat!</em>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <em>Not that ignites and burns down shanties,</em>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <em>But that excites and brings down panties!</em>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <em>Here's to beer,</em>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <em>And here's to heat!</em>
                </p>
                <p>
                    They turned the golden liquid to their lips and raced to finish. Danny first, then Johnny, Billy, and finally Bobby sipped the last drop from his can. They
                    laughed as he struggled to the end and all slapped the youngest on his back. The night had started and it wasn't even dusk.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The craftsmanship was nothing remarkable, but it was sturdy enough. There was a window on each side, it didn't leak, and they were able to cram in about 8
                    people. It was everything it needed to be.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Bobby sat against the tree trunk running up the middle of the treehouse reading a book in the light of a lantern. The occasional bug cast a shadow along
                    the pages. Billy sat across from him against the wall. He drew Bobby; starting with the book and filling in the body behind it. Danny and Johnny were
                    holding an intense conversation on the ethics of peanut buttering a friend's car and the other two joined in as they thought of something interesting to
                    add.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "That's so far from okay. It strips the paint off," Billy chimed in.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Thank you!" Danny stood up to express his appreciation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "You have to leave it on there for week for it to do anything though," Johnny said. "Who would leave their car covered in peanut butter for a week?"
                </p>
                <p>
                    "It messed up a kid in my class' car in like two days," Billy looked back to his drawing, done with backing up his brother.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Nirvana played on a cassette in Johnny's stereo and they listened to it as much as they listened to the breeze coming through the cracks in the windows as
                    much as they listened to each other. After two hours past sunset and a case of beer, their ramblings were interrupted by shouts from outside. Johnny opened
                    up a window and stuck his head out.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Well hello there Mary, Annie, Lizzie!" He shined a flashlight down on them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "A good evening to you, Jonathan! Might you toss us down the ladder?" Mary curtsied.
                </p>
                <p>
                    He put his hand to his chin, pondering the question. "How about you throw me your shirt, and I'll throw you the ladder?" He grinned.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Mary saw a hand come through the window and slap Johnny on the head.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Hey! Jesus, I'm just messing around," he grumbled under his breath and ducked back inside. He was replaced by Danny. "Good evening, Mary. Bobby, please
                    lower the ladder so these fine ladies can join us." A hole opened up in the bottom of the treehouse and a rope ladder fell to hang a foot above the ground.
                    They all piled in the chest of the canopy and hugs ensued. Danny kissed Mary on the eye, Johnny picked up Annie in a bear hug, and Lizzie plopped down
                    between Bobby and Billy, grabbing the sketch from him. Annie pulled a bottle of wine from her backpack and uncorked it, raising it to a wonderful night.
                    Johnny handed beers around from the new case and the seven of them sang their cheer. Bobby and Lizzie still stumbled on the words, but the night had
                    rounded out the edges. The words melted into laughter into memories into stories. The time Billy and Bobby had to sneak into the Wilsons' house. The time
                    Annie and Johnny stuck Danny and Mary together. The first weekend the seven of them stayed in the treehouse.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Saturday was their salvation. Saturday was the world. God could have Sunday, and School could have the week. But they took Friday night by the mane and
                    charged it straight down onto the weekend.
                </p>
                <p>
                    All but one lantern was turned off. Danny sat with his head under a window and his eyes closed into half crescents. Mary's head rested in his lap. Annie
                    and Johnny sat across from them against the tree, his head on her shoulder. The other three slept away from the light; Bobby and Lizzie curled up close
                    together.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Johnny looked at the two youngest and smiled. "That's really sweet, you know?" he said out into the air. "You two together, and the younger brother and
                    sister together."
                </p>
                <p>
                    Danny grinned without opening his eyes. "They're going to be a cute couple if Bobby ever gets the balls to ask her out."
                </p>
                <p>
                    Mary turned in his lap and hit him on the chest. "You're a dick."
                </p>
                <p>
                    "No, I'm a joker. Plus if they're just pretending to sleep and they heard me, then it'll be all the easier for him." Danny finally opened an eye and looked
                    over at the sleeping pair. "Someday, someday. They've got plenty of time."
                </p>
                <p>
                    "What time is it, anyway?" Annie asked.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "2:30," Johnny said.
                </p>
                <p>
                    She sighed long and content and kissed him on the top of the head. "You should take me to bed sweet prince."
                </p>
                <p>
                    Johnny stared into the lantern. "Guys, I think I figured it out," he said.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "What?"
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Why it's summer."
                </p>
                <p>
                    They listened.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "You know how that comet broke up over the Earth a couple years back?"
                </p>
                <p>
                    They remembered.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Well why not that? They said it had probably been centuries since something like that had happened. Maybe it had something to do with the change in
                    temperature."
                </p>
                <p>
                    "That might be the dumbest thing I've ever heard," Annie laughed at him.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Well fuck you too!" He took his head off her shoulder.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Hey come on, maybe he's on to something," Mary tried to console him.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "The only thing he'll ever be onto is me," Annie grinned and the three got into an argument about whether Johnny had ever had a good idea in his life.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "I'm joining the army."
                </p>
                <p>
                    They stopped.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Danny had his eyes closed tight. Head just under the window. Mary no longer next to him. Hands gripping each other in his lap.
                </p>
                <p>
                    They stopped.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "What do you mean?" Mary asked.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "I signed up for the army. And they recruited me."
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Signed up?" She backed against the tree.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Wait are you serious, man?" Johnny stared into his eyes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "You're the only ones I've told. They accepted me two weeks ago. I haven't told Billy or Bobby yet, or my parents," he was whispering now.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "You can't just join the army!" Mary yelled. Danny looked surprised. The sleeping three stirred and settled. "What about Ohio State? What about us? You
                    can't just leave us." She started to cry. Johnny got up and held her.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The breeze had stopped. They were quiet.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "When do you leave?" Johnny asked over her shoulder.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "The beginning of May. They said I can graduate early."
                </p>
                <p>
                    Mary made a small sound.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "When are you going to tell your family?" He asked.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "I needed to tell you first."
                </p>
                <p>
                    They stood there for a while.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "I know why it's summer," Annie said, looking at the lantern.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Danny kept his eyes closed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "It's for you. For before you leave."
                </p>
                <p>
                    All the crickets in the world were silent when she said it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Danny pulled his knees into his chest.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "It's for us. The four of us," Johnny said. "Why do you think you just up and decided to build this place last year?"
                </p>
                <p>
                    "That's stupid."
                </p>
                <p>
                    "It's better than my idea."
                </p>
                <p>
                    The treehouse cradled them high above the ground. Above the leaves of the winter and the growth of the summer. It was halfway between the Earth and the
                    clouds, the roots and the leaves. They stayed there for a very long time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Danny stood up for Mary. She clutched him tight, burying her face in his shoulder.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "I'll be back in November, and you'll be back for winter break," he said.
                </p>
                <p>
                    She took a bit to respond. "I know."
                </p>
                <p>
                    They held each other up.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "You're really doing this, aren't you?" the words were muffled in his shirt.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Yeah. I've thought about it a lot. I've made up my mind."
                </p>
                <p>
                    "I know," she said.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The next morning smelled like the night before. They all roused as the sun peeked through the cracks in the windows and onto their eyelids. Not much was
                    said as the seven nursed their headaches. They rolled up sleeping bags and collected the bits of trash. Bobby stayed close to Lizzie. The rest stayed close
                    to Danny.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "I'm gonna miss this," Annie was the one to finally say it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    They all agreed, saying they'd had some great times in the short while they had the treehouse, that the younger three would have to keep it up. They filed
                    down. Billy then Bobby, Lizzie behind him. Annie then Mary.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Johnny started down the ladder. "You know, you're going to be in basic training for the hottest part of the year. This is like paradise compared to
                    Georgia," he said.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Honestly, I think there's a very good chance it'll be Christmas in July."
                </p>
                <p>
                    Johnny laughed and nodded. "Well here's to heat," he grinned and ducked below the floor.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Danny put a foot on the ladder. The treehouse cradled him high above the ground. Above the leaves, new and old. Whenever the Earth shook. Whenever the
                    seasons melted together. He looked out the window, halfway across the world. He stepped down into the chill of the morning.

                    We decided to skip school.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The bus was too crowded and the day was too nice.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We walked in the direction of the bus stop because our momma stood on the porch as we left, but we jumped behind the big patch of hydrangeas once we
                    rounded the corner.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We watched our classmates through the bush.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Only after the huge billow of diesel exhaust had settled did we dare to move.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We walked, for the sunniest and right near most perfect two hours that any two kids have ever walked, to the lake on the edge of town.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We brought along four cans of pop, a couple of sandwiches, our fishing poles and tackle (we went back and waited behind the shed until we knew momma had
                    left for the store), and all the necessities for a day at the lake, playing cards and Archie comic books, anything and everything that makes fishing the
                    best day out from behind a desk.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It wasn't until the sun had passed on over the cap of the sky, once the morning birds settled down for the afternoon, when the shadows had started to
                    mingle with our feet again, that we got a bite.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We pulled on the rod; the fish broke the surface; drops of water hung in the air.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It could've been the prettiest fish in the world; it could've been every color of the sky; it could've been the most beautiful mount in our living room;
                    but it was a lake-bed-brown five foot northern pike with a crick in its jaw; the most spectacular fish either of us had ever seen.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We imagined telling our dad the whole story, how it almost pulled us into the water, how we dragged it up onto the bank, how we knew there was no way the line would hold; but we imagined him telling us to go out back to the shed for skipping school.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We took the hook out of its mouth; the fish slowed its squirming when it felt the cool lake rise up around its belly; giving one last look at the ripples it made in the water, we opened our palms, and watched it rush back off into the depths of the lake, never to be caught again.

                    Without a reason at all I felt comforted by the shop's dirt-brown walls, like it had been dry roasted and left to jerky out in the sun. "Bryce's Body
                    Shop", the sign looked down on the road with chunky red and yellow vibrant letters that seemed to be the only thing with color on the dusty strip of
                    highway other than Miss Ida across the street in her wonderfully green sundress and comically yellow sun hat. She ran "Ida's," the only store around for 45
                    minutes, give or take a few road signs, it together with Bryce's garage made the township (or maybe friendship, population of two and as I found out, no
                    official recognition from the county seat) of Gouyen, New Mexico: a smidge off of I-40 right in between Amarillo, TX and Tucumcari, NM with a good 60 miles
                    on either side. On the edge of one of those 60 miles I caught a shiver in my engine and lurched halfway over the endless dashed yellows of the Midwest
                    highways, steam tooting out of my hood like it was filled with coal. With half a cell signal I found my way to a cheery "hullo, sounds good, on-ma-way" and
                    Bryce the wizened mechanic rolled up in a classic rusty red slapped together tow truck.
                </p>
                <p>
                    He walked over to me from the garage and shoved a hunk of metal in my face "you got yourself a faulty head gasket." I felt pretty sure that he had taken
                    out more of my engine than he needed but the lack of oil on my face and years crusted in my hands left me nodding, thanking, and exhausted at the 6 hours I
                    had to kill on the border of Texas and New Mexico, not the most exciting of state lines, with no cell service and a car every three hours to stop and chat
                    with Miss Ida, pick up some goods, and wander away again in a rustle of dust. "And your coolant is blacker than your tires. And speaking of, those would be
                    well off with a rotation, too." Bryce showed me to an old but leather recliner in his living room with a table-full of magazines and 11 channels of TV. He
                    told me to help myself to a glass of water and said if I was a sweet-talker I could probably get a treat from Miss Ida on the store. Car and Driver, Sports
                    Illustrated, somewhat-local news, two glasses of water, a trip to the bathroom and out onto the porch. It was hot, but not dust-hot, closer to warm, not
                    enough to make me sweat. I sat on a rocking chair facing the garage and watched Bryce bent over the motor, rag sticking out of the back pocket of his
                    jumpsuit. Across the road Miss Ida swayed in a porch swing to the side of her store, green dress catching the air at her knees. Bryce stole glances at her
                    and she pretended to not see, kicking her eyes up to the sky and back down to his behind whenever he bent back over the engine.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I took Bryce up on his suggestion and went over to Ida's. "Wonderful to meet you, Mr. Carlton." She had the voice of an old Georgia and manners that
                    matched her age, politely near demanding I take a seat on the swing with her and off she passed into the doors of her store, back out a moment later with
                    what could've been her favorite silver platter of two glasses, two cake forks, two saucers, a lemon bar on each, and a pitcher of lemonade. I felt we were
                    both pretty good at watching Old Bryce, but she had a real knack for it. "Would you do me a favor Mr. Carlton?" I agreed, smiled to be of service, and
                    accepted the letter she gave me for Bryce. "Walk that right on over there and tell him it's no rush at all, not to worry a moment."
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Well isn't that the sweetest. She asked me over for dinner tonight." Bryce looked up and waved at her and she waved back, smile on her face. Bryce went
                    back to work whistling a tune that sounded a bit outdated, myself left with no idea what I had just been a part of and for what reason, but I knew and
                    loved that all had ended well so I asked Bryce if he and Miss Ida were dating. He took to telling me three or four times that was the funniest idea he had
                    heard in all his 45 years of being a mechanic in Gouyen and when I asked Miss Ida, she found the idea even funnier than Bryce and couldn't think in all 40
                    years of selling groceries had a customer said anything "so outlandish. But what a wonderful idea." We talked a while longer on the porch swing about my
                    trip west and how she ended up in New Mexico and how hardheaded Old Bryce can be but that he's cuter than the underside of a buttercup when he gets
                    flustered. And then we sat in comfortable silence, she reading a book, me watching the clouds.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The day dimmed down lower to the overtones of a dusty evening, sun falling perfectly towards the horizon just above the interstate falling off into the
                    distance. At the edge of the sun being bright and the sun being beautiful, Bryce called me over across the road and told me the damage, not too bad all
                    considered, and my car was a joy to work with, a nice hunk of metal and that as much as he'd like to see me back, knew it would be humming all the way to
                    the coast. A firm handshake and a holler to Miss Ida, I was on the road enjoying the sound of a healthy engine and watching Gouyen, New Mexico fade away in
                    my rearview mirror, Old Bryce crossing the interstate wiping his hands on the rag in his back pocket and slicking his hair back, Miss Ida standing holding
                    her book across her chest, waiting for him.
